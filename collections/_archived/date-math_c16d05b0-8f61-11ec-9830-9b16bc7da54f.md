  math with dates**.<br>You can add and subtract minutes/hours/days/years (and
  more) to a specific date or the current date and time, in any format you like.
  You can also get the difference between two dates/times. *Useful to know how
  much time is left until certain event.*<br><br>**Commands**:<br>1. Date Math:
  Very powerful command with a lot of options. You can do math and format the
  dates/times as you want, even with text. You can also use it to get the
  current date and time.<br>2. Date Diff: Get the difference between two dates
  and/or times.<br><br>**Formatting**:<br><br>One of the main features of the
  extension is the ability to do math in any date/time format you want, even
  adding text to it. You can even format a date without doing math. Read
  carefully the guide before playing with it.<br><br>**Important**:<br><br>The
  commands have many options. Please read the extensive documentation (with
  examples) in the GitHub repository before using it.<br><br>Documentation:
