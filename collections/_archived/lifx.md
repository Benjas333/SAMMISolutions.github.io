overview: |
    **This extension allows you to fully control your LIFX lights. It is superior to using IFTTT as there's an extremely short delay and you can execute requests in rapid succession.**\
    All you need is to get your LIFX token which is a very simple process that takes less than a minute. 

    **Features:**
    - List all my lights (Bridge only) - lists all your LIFX devices and their current state/manufacturer information
    - Get Light - gets a state of one single light
    - Toggle Power 
    - Activate Scene 
    - Set State
    - State Delta
    - Effects: Breathe, Flame, Morph, Move, Pulse
    - Effects Off 
    - Clean Mode  

    The extension also has a `fast mode` where you can execute the command without initial state checks and wait for no results. You could potentially implement this with a Reenable If command to rapidly change your light effects.
