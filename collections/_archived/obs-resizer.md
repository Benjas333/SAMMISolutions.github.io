overview: |
    **OBS Resizer allows you to resize your scenes, nested scenes and their sources with one push of a button.**  

    This is extremely useful if you decide to switch to a different video resolution or you often create and share your scene collections with other people who  need them for a different resolution.  

    If you've ever had to change all your pixel-size perfect scenes to another canvas size, you know how much of a hassle it was and how long it took you to get it all back to perfection. Not anymore, one button does it all!  

    As a bonus, the extension should automatically resize your crop and move source filters, so you don't need to worry about manually redoing them! Please note there might be very minor adjustments needed in some cases. 

    **Special thanks goes to [MisterK](twitch.tv/misterk_qc) for migrating the extension to  SAMMI.** 
setup: |
    1. Install the extension.
    2. It comes with a premade deck where you need to change only two values - your scene name and the original width you're resizing it from. After that you can just press the button and let all the magic happen.
