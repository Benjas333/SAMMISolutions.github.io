overview: |
    **Advanced Button Functions** is an extension that allows you to run a random button, check if a button is running or blocked, and more!

    **Features**  
    - Run a random button from a specified deck or group
    - Check if a button is currently running, in queue (and how many are in queue), or blocked.
    - Get all running and blocked buttons 
    - Get all buttons by triggers
    - Stop all buttons in a selected deck
    - Get button information (deck name, group id, image name, init variables, etc.)

    Comes with a premade deck with all available commands and explanations.

    **Important Notes**  
    This extension may stop working if there are any major updates to SAMMI Core. If that happens, please reach out to me, and I'll do my best to help and see if an updated version can be released.
