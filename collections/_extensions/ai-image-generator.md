    Prompt	|The image description, the more detailed the better, max 1000 characters
    Amount|	Amount of images to generate, between 1-10
    Size	|Size of the generated image
    Response|	Save the image as a file or as a URL. If saving it as a file, it will be saved in your SAMMI folder/Ext/image generations. To prevent files from being accidentally overridden, the filename is automatically generated in the following format: `DALL路E {timestamp} - {truncated prompt}_{index}.png`
    Save As Variable|	Variable to save the result into, won't be set at all if generating failed. If saving the image as a file, it will be an array containing all image file paths. If saving the image as a URL, it will be an array containing all image URLs
    Save as Variable (status) | Variable to save the status result into. If the request succeeds, it will be set to `1`, if not, it will be set to `0`
