    ##### ChatGPT Ask
    Sends one single question/prompt to ChatGPT without it remembering any previous conversations.   
    This is very cheap as it doesn't need to remember any previous chats. If you want to have a continuous chat, however, use 'ChatGPT Chat' command instead. 

    <div class="alert alert-info mt-2" role="alert">Image generation can take a while. Adjut your delays accordingly, 60 seconds or more is recommended to account for high traffic.</div>

    | Box Name | Description| 
    |-------|--------|
    Prompt | The prompt/question to send to ChatGPT |
    Maximum Tokens | Maximum amount of tokens to be in the response. Defaults to 4096 if unset, where one token is around 4 characters in English. You might need to experiment a bit to avoid incomplete sentences.|
    Completion Amount | The amount of completions (answers) ChatGPT provides. Defaults to 1. Be careful with setting it to high numbers as it can rack up your token cost. |
    Save Variable As | Variable name to save the response to. If Completion Amount is 1, the variable will be the response ChatGPT returned. If Completion Amount is more than 1, the variable will be an array  containing all responses |
    {:class='table table-secondary w-auto table-hover text-break' }
