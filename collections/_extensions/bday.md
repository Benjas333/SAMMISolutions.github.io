    #### 📅 How it works
    
    Viewers can register their birthday with a simple chat command with !setbday <day>.<month> (you can also change this to <month>.<day>. in the settings.
    Once they’ve set their birthday, on the first message they send on their special day, a celebration will automatically trigger on stream:
    
    - 🍰 A birthday cake appears
    - 🏷️ A banner with their username shows up
    - 🎶 A Happy Birthday song plays
    
    #### 💡 Notes:
    
    - The celebration only triggers once per user per birthday (on their first message).
    - Only the day and month are required (no year).
    - The extension uses the streamer’s local time.
