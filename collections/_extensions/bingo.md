    #### Submission
    
    - Users can submit bingo fields with the "Submit a bingo idea" channel point reward
    - Submissions are linked to the current category, so for example Super Metroid Submissions will go into the Super Metroid Pool
    - Submissions are all stored in seperate text files to make the editing of submissions easier
    
    
    #### Board Generation
    
    - Upon accumulating a minimum of 25 submissions, the extension dynamically creates a randomized bingo board with a simple command
    
    
    #### Completing the board
    
    - Modify the option to complete a board, for example you can use the classic 5-in-a-row, completing the entire board, or reaching a specified number of completed fields
    - Tracks the time taken to complete a bingo board, adding an element of challenge and competition
    
    
    #### Deck App Support
    
    - Seamlessly control the bingo board through SAMMI Panel, Deck Hopper, or Deck Mate.
    
    
    #### Available Commands
    
    - !newbingo (creates a new board and shows it)
    - !showbingo (shows the board)
    - !hidebingo (hides the board)
    - !bingo <field> (for example !bingo B1 => toggles the B1 field (either completed or not completed))
