Control your game experience through crowd interaction using Crowd Control and SAMMI

## Setup

1. Inside SAMMI go to **SAMMI Bridge**, select **Install an Extension** and then the `Crowd Control.sef` file  
2. Select the platform, username, game, and pack in the Bridge.

## Crowd Control Commands

SAMMI offers several commands for Crowd Control. These commands may take a short time to execute. It is recommended to use **Wait Until Variable Exists** for handling results.

| Get Game List           | Returns an object array with all available Crowd Control games.             |
| Get Connection Status   | Returns `0` if not connected, and `1` if connected.                        |
