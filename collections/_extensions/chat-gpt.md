    Allows you to talk to ChatGPT directly in SAMMI, including remembering multiple different conversations. 

    ##### Features
    **Ask ChatGPT once**  

    Sends one single prompt to ChatGPT. You can specify completion choice amount and maximum tokens you wish to use for the response.   

    **Chat with ChatGPT**   
    Allows for a continuous conversation with ChatGPT. It remembers what's been discussed in previous conversations. You can switch between multiple conversations at will. 

    ##### Important information
    - ChatGPT is a paid service, it requires an OpenAI account and a credit card
    - You must monitor your own token usage and set token usage limits (described in the setup guide)
 
    *By installing this extension you're agreeing to be monitoring your own token usage and cost, and NOT using the extension (i.e. uninstalling it from Bridge) if you notice a high token usage. In that case, please report it to Christina on Itch or Discord.*
