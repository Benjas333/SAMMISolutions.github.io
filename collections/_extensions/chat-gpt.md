overview: |
   
    Allows you to talk to ChatGPT directly in SAMMI, including remembering multiple different conversations. 

    ##### Features
    **Ask ChatGPT once**  

    Sends one single prompt to ChatGPT. You can specify completion choice amount and maximum tokens you wish to use for the response.   

    **Chat with ChatGPT**   
    Allows for a continuous conversation with ChatGPT. It remembers what's been discussed in previous conversations. You can switch between multiple conversations at will. 

    ##### Important information
    - ChatGPT is a paid service, it requires an OpenAI account and a credit card
    - You must monitor your own token usage and set token usage limits (described in the setup guide)
 
    *By installing this extension you're agreeing to be monitoring your own token usage and cost, and NOT using the extension (i.e. uninstalling it from Bridge) if you notice a high token usage. In that case, please report it to Christina on Itch or Discord.*

    ##### PLEASE REVIEW BEFORE USING THE EXTENSION: 
    - ChatGPT is a paid service, it requires an OpenAI account and a credit card
    - Always [monitor your token usage](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage) via the official OpenAI dashboard
    - [Set token usage limits](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits) via the official OpenAI dashboard (more info in green comment)
    - You are responsible for tracking your own token usage
    - As this an early release of the extension, it could potentially lead to higher token usage due to user error or possible bugs. For that reason, please SET YOUR USAGE LIMITS!

    1. Install the extension. You can follow the [Extension Install Guide](https://sammi.solutions/extensions/install).
    2. Setup your INIT button
       - `API Key`: 
            1. Navigate to [https://platform.openai.com/signup](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
            2. Login or create a new account
            3. Click on 'Personal' profile in the top right corner and select View API Keys
            4. Create a new secret key
            5. Copy paste the key in the API Key box in the INIT button
            6. Set up your payment method (else it won't work - the service is not free)
            7. Set you token usage limits at [https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits)
       - `Token Usage Session Limit`:
            - SAMMI can limit how many tokens can be used per a session
            - one session lasts until Bridge is reloaded (closed and reopened)
            - once the limit is reached, no more messages can be sent to ChatGPT
            - you can reset the limit with ChatGPT Reset Token Usage command
            - this is purely informative, you still need to set your total limits via [https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits)

    ##### ChatGPT Ask
    Sends one single question/prompt to ChatGPT without it remembering any previous conversations.   
    This is very cheap as it doesn't need to remember any previous chats. If you want to have a continuous chat, however, use 'ChatGPT Chat' command instead. 

    <div class="alert alert-info mt-2" role="alert">This command can take a while to execute (10-20 seconds), so adjust your delay or timeout commands accordingly. </div>

    | Box Name | Description| 
    |-------|--------|
    Prompt | The prompt/question to send to ChatGPT |
    Maximum Tokens | Maximum amount of tokens to be in the response. Defaults to 4096 if unset, where one token is around 4 characters in English. You might need to experiment a bit to avoid incomplete sentences.|
    Completion Amount | The amount of completions (answers) ChatGPT provides. Defaults to 1. Be careful with setting it to high numbers as it can rack up your token cost. |
    Save Variable As | Variable name to save the response to. If Completion Amount is 1, the variable will be the response ChatGPT returned. If Completion Amount is more than 1, the variable will be an array  containing all responses |
    {:class='table table-secondary w-auto table-hover text-break' }

    ##### ChatGPT Chat
    Use this command for a continuous conversation with ChatGPT. It should remember what's been discussed in previous conversations (as long as you don't 
    change browsers or clear your local browser data).  

    This might get EXPENSIVE, as it has to send the chat history (or its summary) each  time you use the command. This is all automatically handled, make sure you watch your token cost.   

    For simple one time queries you should use 'ChatGPT Ask' command instead which uses less tokens.   

    <div class="alert alert-info mt-2" role="alert">This command can take a while to execute (10-20 seconds), so adjust your delay or timeout commands accordingly. </div>

    | Box Name | Description| 
    |-------|--------|
    Conversation Type | Whether to continue your previous existing chat or create a new one
    Conversation Name | Select from the dropdown for existing chats or type in a new chat name
    Maximum Tokens | Maximum amount of tokens to be in the response. One token is around 4 characters in English. You might need to experiment a bit to avoid incomplete sentences.
    Message | The prompt to send to ChatGPT
    Save Variable As | Variable name to save the response as
    {:class='table table-secondary w-auto table-hover' }

    ##### ChatGPT Get Token Usage
    Retrieves your current session token usage and approximate cost. One session lasts until Bridge is reloaded (closed and reopened).

    <div class="alert alert-warning mt-2" role="alert">This is separate from usage you set in OpenAI dashboard, purely informative and should not be 100% relied on.</div>  
    
    | Box Name | Description| 
    |-------|--------|
    Save Variable As | Variable name to save the token usage to
    {:class='table table-secondary w-auto table-hover' }

    ##### ChatGPT Reset Token Usage
    You can manually reset your session token usage you set up in the INIT button with this command. One session lasts until Bridge is reloaded (closed and reopened).
    
    <div class="alert alert-warning mt-2" role="alert"> Setting and resetting session token limit via SAMMI is separate from usage you set in OpenAI dashboard and should be only used as guidance.</div>
