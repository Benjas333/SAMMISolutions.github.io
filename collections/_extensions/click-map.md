overview: |
    **Let your viewers interact with your stream by directly clicking on your live video overlay!**  


    You can map your OBS sources and let your viewers take full control!  

    One single tap to activate a different camera? And another tap to change the whole scene?\
    Or how about having your viewers decide which path to take in a video game you're playing by simply tapping on the video to vote?  

    **You can retrieve the name of the viewer who clicked and the exact coordinates!**  

    **The extension newly comes with an overlay to visualize your viewers clicks!** 
   
    Available only for SAMMI. Supports both OBSWS 4 and OBSWS 5.\
    Utilizes Heat Twitch extension made by [Scott Garner](https://github.com/scottgarner).  

   
    <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">The extension doesn't work for viewers on mobile devices due to Twitch's own limitation on overlay extensions.</div>
