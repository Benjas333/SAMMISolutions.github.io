overview: >-
  Completly editable automatic Credit Roll by RoadieGamer. Only works for twitch
  currently. When there is a Donations Extension I will update to include
  donations.
setup: >-
  Credit Roll for SAMMI <br><br>Make sure you are on SAMMI 2.07 and up, OBSWS 4.9.1
  and your OBS is open before installing.<br><br>- After install you can delete
  the First time run button if install was sucessful.<br>- You can adjust all
  settings in the settings button, take a look around to see what is
  editable.<br>- If you accidently delete something in the settings button I
  have a default button seperate so that you can just import that JSON<br>- To
  start the credit roll click the BIG RED BUTTON! <br>- To end the credit roll
  you can click stop credit roll or press to stop all and delete credits<br>-
  The latter will delete the current information that the credit roll has for
  your stream. It is a good way to prep for a stream if you were testing things
  beforehand<br>- Restore CSV's from backup will restore the last working data
  in the case of SAMMI crashing or windows crashing.  
  /$global.main_directory$/\Credit Roll  <br>- When SAMMI is properly closed. It
  moves the current backup to the backup folder inside
  /$global.main_directory$/\Credit Roll\old and deletes the old backup data<br>-
  Put the newly created scene wherever you would like the Credit Roll to show up
  when running<br><br>DO NOT BOTHER LIORAN ABOUT THIS EXTENSION NOT
  WORKING<br><br>Happy streaming everyone!<br>
