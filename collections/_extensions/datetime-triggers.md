    *DateTime Triggers* is an extension that allows you to trigger buttons in SAMMI based on date and time triggers, including custom conditions, such as whether you're currently live or a variable has a specific value.

    #### Available Trigger Types:

    - **Hourly:** Triggers at a specified minute after every hour.
    - **Daily:** Triggers at a specified hour and minute every day.
    - **Weekly:** Triggers on specified days at a set hour and minute.
    - **Monthly:** Triggers on a specified day, hour, and minute every month.
    - **Specific Day of the Year:** Triggers once a year on a specified day, hour, and minute.
    - **One-Time Trigger:** Triggers on a specified date and time.
    - **Trigger from Date:** Triggers only within a specified date range.

    #### Date Range Condition:
    - Set a date range condition for an existing trigger to only activate within a specific date range.

    #### Custom Conditions:
    - **Stream Status:** Triggers based on your Twitch stream status (Live/Offline).
    - **Stream Category:** Triggers based on your current Twitch stream category.
    - **Viewer Threshold:** Triggers based on a minimum Twitch viewer count.
    - **OBS:** Triggers based on whether OBS is connected or disconnected.
    - **OBS Scene:** Triggers based on a specific OBS scene.
    - **Variable Name == Value:** Triggers based on a specific variable having a specific value.

    #### Important Note
    Custom conditions, such as a viewer threshold, only work for your main connected Twitch account. YouTube is not supported at this time.
