overview: |
    **Dynamic Triggers** is an extension that allows you to attach triggers to buttons dynamically via SAMMI commands.  
    These triggers work in the same way as your regular button triggers, but you can attach them to buttons on the fly.

    **Features**  
    - Add a dynamic trigger to a button (persists through SAMMI resets, must be readded between SAMMI restarts)
    - Modify an existing dynamic trigger
    - Remove a dynamic trigger from a button
    - See all active dynamic triggers

    **Supported Triggers**
    - Twitch Chat Message
    - Youtube Chat Message
    - Extension
    - SAMMI Voice
    - Webhook

    Other triggers will be considered based on custom commissions./
    Timers and hotkeys as DT will not work, please keep that in mind for any future suggestions.

    Comes with a premade deck with all available commands and explanations.

    **Important Notes**
    This extension may stop working if there are any significant updates to SAMMI Core. If that happens, please contact the developer for an update.
