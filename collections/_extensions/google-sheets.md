overview: |
    **Access and manipulate data in your Google Sheets straight from SAMMI!**  
    For instance, you can set up your own leaderboard and easily share it with others.

    **Important Reminder**  
    This extension only works with public Google Spreadsheets that were created using it. It wonâ€™t be able to access or edit any of your other files.  
    There are some limits on the number of read and write actions you can perform per minute (more details in the documentation).

    **Available commands**  
    - Get Data, Find Data  
    - Append Data, Update Data, Batch Update, Copy Paste, Clear Data  
    - Auto Fill, Auto Sort, Randomize, Find and Replace, Delete Duplicates, Split Text  
    - Merge Cells, Unmerge Cells, Insert Range, Delete Range  
    - Create Spreadsheet, Duplicate Sheet, Add Sheet  

    **Who is this for?**  
    This extension is ideal for users with a basic to advanced knowledge of Google Spreadsheets. You should also be somewhat familiar with SAMMI (like understanding how objects and arrays work).  
    With these skills, you can quickly add, edit, sort, and retrieve data directly within SAMMI!
