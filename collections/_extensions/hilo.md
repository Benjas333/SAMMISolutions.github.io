overview: |
    This game creates a guessing game for Twitch & YouTube.
    The viewers need to guess if the next card is higher or lower than the current card.
    If they are lucky enough to get the same card, it's a freebie.
    
    You can customise the rules like the amount of lives, if the player should be automatically assigned VIP status to avoid the prevention of multiple same messages in a row and many other things.
    There is also a leaderboard.
    
    The following commands are available:
    
    - `!hilo` => Start a new game
    - `+ / -` => Guess if the next card is higher or lower (ace is the highest card)
    - `!hilo-rank` => Check out your rank and the current top 10
