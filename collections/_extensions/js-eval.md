    Allows you to utilize the full power of **Javascript Evaluations**.

    Adds 1 "Javascript Eval" command. return value can be saved to a SAMMI variable. 

    Example deck is available in [the Examples directory](https://github.com/prodzpod/SAMMI-Extensions/tree/main/Examples) in the code repository. The code is available to examine and download on [github](https://github.com/prodzpod/SAMMI-Extensions/tree/main).

    # Disclaimer

    DO NOT download or run decks and buttons utilizing JS Eval from other people unless you are ABSOLUTELY sure what you are doing! JS is very powerful and can be dangerous to your computer and personal information.
