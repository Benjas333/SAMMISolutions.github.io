  ## 🔥 What is MickFX?

  **MickFX** is a collection of stream effects for SAMMI that let you react, entertain, and hype your viewers in real time. Whether it’s a sword slicing through your webcam or a chaotic spaceship ride with Rick and Morty — MickFX makes your stream feel **alive**, **dynamic**, and **unforgettable**.

  ## 🎬 Description

  MickFX delivers instant, customizable stream effects triggered through your SAMMI Bridge. With 10+ effects (and more on the way), you can transform your stream into a **visually reactive experience** that keeps people watching — and laughing.

  From turning your stream into LEGO bricks to summoning Jutsu clones for backup, MickFX doesn’t just enhance your gameplay — it makes **you** the main attraction.

  🧩 No coding needed. Just install MickFX Base into SAMMI and follow the included instructions, then go to MickFX.com and choose your effects. You’ll be up and running in minutes.

  ## 🚀 How It Works

  Each effect runs through SAMMI and is triggered by an event — a click on the effect icon, a Twitch command, channel point redemption, or whatever you assign.

  When triggered, the effect instantly plays on your OBS stream with animation, sound, and style. Examples:

  💬 `WASTED!` → The classic GTA fail screen slams your stream — perfect for dramatic moments.  
  🎯 `Pixellate` → A warp pipe appears and transforms your webcam into an 8-bit version.  
  🧨 `Barrel Roll` → Rick crashes onto the screen in his spaceship and takes you for a chaotic spin. Morty’s fate? Unknown.

  MickFX Base is used as the foundation extension, and each effect is its own individual add-on extension.

  ## ⚙️ Customization Options

  Each effect is designed to be flexible and streamer-friendly. You can tweak:

  * 🐺 **VTuber or Webcam Mode** – Choose between a Webcam or VTuber mode and have MickFX adjust your overlays/text accordingly.
  * 🎵 **Frame or No Frame** – Choose whether effects include your webcam frame or affect just the cam feed.
  * ⏱️ **Duration Control** – Set how long each effect plays for.
  * 🔄 **Effect Variations** – Many effects have adjustable options: easing, zoom type, rotation, and more.

  💡 More effects and new add-ons are always in the works — keep an eye out for updates!
