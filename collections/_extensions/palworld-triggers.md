    Palworld Triggers is an extension for SAMMI that allows you to listen to specific in-game events and trigger buttons within SAMMI.

    **Features**
    - **Pal Captured and Incubated**: Triggered when a pal is captured or incubated, providing details like pal level, name, passive skills, and capture count.
    - **Base Invasion Alerts**: Triggered when your base is under attack or being visited by an NPC, providing details like enemy names.
    - **Chat Message Integration**: Captures all in-game chat messages, allowing you to view details like the message sender.
    - **Complete Pal Inventory**: A special feature that retrieves a list of all your owned pals, and information such as their names, levels, skills, and more.
    - **API Commands for Dedicated Servers:**
        - Get server info and metrics.
        - Get list of current players.
        - Send announcement messages in chat.
        - Kick, ban, and unban players from the server.
        - Save & Shut down the server remotely.
        - And more!

    **Beta Version Warning**  

    Please be aware that **Palworld Triggers** is currently in its beta phase. Any updates to Palworld may cause the extension to stop working. We are working hard to ensure that the extension is updated as soon as possible after any changes to the game.

    **Important Notes**  

    This extension requires the download of **RE-UE4SS** as a dependency. 
    The extension has been extensively tested on a dedicated server, and should be fully functional in single-player and public servers. However, as this is a beta release, some features may not be fully polished.
