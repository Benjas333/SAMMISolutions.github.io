    **Patreon events delivered straight to your SAMMI!**  

    Honoring your loyal Patrons and automatically thanking for their contributions while you stream is now finally possible with this extension!  

    **Triggers**  
    Create, Update and Delete member - every time someone follows you or pledges to you\
    Create, Update and Delete Member pledge - every time someone pledges to you and becomes your patron

    **Important Note**  
    There are testing buttons on Patreon for all the triggers. However, they tend to deliver slightly different payloads than the real events. The extension is configured for real events.
