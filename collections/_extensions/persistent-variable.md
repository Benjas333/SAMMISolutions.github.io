    # Features

    Allows you to set and retrieve variables that persists between sessions, meaning it will stay even after you turn off SAMMI.

    Adds two commands: `Get` and `Set Persistent Variable` that works similarly to other get/set variable SAMMI commands.

    The persistent variables are saved in your SAMMI directory as `persistent_variables.json`.

    The code is available to examine and download on [github](https://github.com/prodzpod/SAMMI-Extensions/tree/main).

    # Disclaimer

    If you have any **questions**, **help** or **bugs to report** while using this extension, please message me at @pr_d on discord! I'd be glad to help you out.

    After installing, you must **restart** SAMMI or trigger the "Load" button in the newly loaded deck.

    Please do not remove or disable the deck, as it is needed for the extension to work properly.
