overview: >-
  Animated Pokemon Shoutout that pulls a random clip, the profile picture and
  the bio of the one you want to shoutout.<br><br>Also works automatically with
  raids.<br>Can be freely adjusted to go with any theme of your choice (pokemon
  is just an example).<br>
setup: >-
  To install this, please follow these steps:<br><br>1. Download and install the
  source copy plugin for OBS:
  https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/source-copy.1261/<br>2. Import the
  ShoutoutScene.json in OBS (Tools => Source Copy => Load Scene)<br>   Make sure
  to select the correct scene for your canvas size (if you use another Canvas
  Size than 720 or 1080p, use the 720p and just resize the sources in OBS)<br>3.
  Copy the files from the SAMMI folder inside this installation folder inside your
  SAMMI folder (the shoutout.html directly into the root folder and the
  Shoutout.png inside your image folder)<br>4. Install the .sef file (inside SAMMI
  hit Bridge => Install an extension)<br>5. Include the "Shoutout Animation
  Scene" (not the Shoutout Scene) in the scenes were you want to use it as a
  nested scene<br>6. Restart SAMMI<br><br>Other things:<br><br>- If this Extension
  crashes, make sure you have set the correct scopes inside SAMMI (View Email
  adress is needed)<br>- Your SAMMI Bridge also needs to be connected.<br>-
  Also if you wanna use a bot account or change settings, check out the green
  parts in the buttons.<br>- When no Clip is available, it will only send a chat
  message.<br>- Last but not least, if you use the SAMMI Bridge to test for
  Raids, this will often not work since the Bridge only sends dummy
  data<br>- Feel free to move around the graphics / to exchange the Shoutout
  Background picture to create your own
  overlay<br><br>https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/jtv_user_pictures/3887579e-7b84-403e-9ed1-cc17c9789b1e-profile_image-300x300.png
