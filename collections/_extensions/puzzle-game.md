    **Unleash the fun with the Puzzle Game extension! Transform any OBS source into an interactive game where your viewers swap pieces to solve the puzzle, right from the chat!** 

    Whether you're away from your screen or looking for a fresh way to engage with your audience, this is the perfect tool. Create a captivating puzzle from any scene or source instantly!

    **Seamless Setup**  
    Creating a new puzzle is as easy as 1-2-3! Select an OBS source, set the desired difficulty, and voila! The extension does the rest, automatically generating a new scene with all the pieces and their coordinates.  
    Just hit the 'Start' button and let the fun begin! (In some instances, minor adjustments to the size/position of the nested scene might be necessary.)

    **Unlimited Puzzle Scenes**  
    Why limit the fun to one scene? Create puzzles for multiple sources or scenes! Switch between them as you wish, based on your current scene!

    **Ultimate Customization**  
    Personalize your puzzle game to your taste! Choose the grid size for puzzle difficulty, tailor the borders and margins between pieces, select a font for coordinates, and handpick colors for every element!

    **Animated Fun and Sound Effects**  

    Watch as the puzzle pieces shuffle and move in smooth animations! Enjoy optional sound effects or swap them out with your personal favorites!

    **Automatic Winner Announcements**  
    The game knows when the puzzle is solved, and it even keeps a tally of which viewer correctly placed the most pieces!

    **Reshuffle and Surrender Commands**  
    You and your mods have the power to reshuffle or auto-solve the puzzle anytime.

    **Leaderboard**  
    Track the champions of your Puzzle games with a fully automatic leaderboard for current and past games.
