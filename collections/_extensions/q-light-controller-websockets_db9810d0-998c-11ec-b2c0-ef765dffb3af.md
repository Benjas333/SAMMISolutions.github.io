overview: >-
  This QLC+.lbe is a SAMMI extension to control Q Light Controller Plus
  software using webSockets.<br>Control your DMX lights by SAMMI
setup: >-
  To setup the extension simply install it on SAMMI
  software.<br>To prepare QLC + you have to run the program with websocket
  flags. To do it simply run it with `-w` flag which means websockets have to be
  turned on.<br>Ref:
  https://www.qlcplus.org/docs/html_en_EN/commandlineparameters.html<br><br>Personally
  I prefer to create some `.bat` file with following command:<br>```<br>cd
  "C:\QLC+" (Path to your QLC)<br>start qlcplus.exe -w -p -o
  "C:/Path/YourWorkspace.qxw"<br>```<br>where:<br><br>`-w` -
  websockets<br><br>`-p` - program starts in performance mode<br><br>`-o` -
  program loads up a workspace on startup<br><br><br>You can also create a
  shortcut with
  flags<br><br>![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36815427/156162647-161fa0dd-cea0-453b-a947-a0523549544f.png)<br><br>Now
  you open SAMMI software and run transmiter.html file (normally you would
  put it in OBS as a source)<br>On the Bridge page you can check your
  connection to QLC

  you can load your defined QLC functions with corresponding IDs, which will be
  needed for using SAMMI commands.<br><br>
