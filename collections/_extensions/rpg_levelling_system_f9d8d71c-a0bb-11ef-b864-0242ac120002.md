overview: |
  This extension adds a handful of commands that let you create Skills and let users level up skills (similar to RuneScape). All the commands dynamically update based on the skills you've added to make it an easy experience for you!

  ## Features

  - Easy Setup, 1-Click Install.
  - Easy config
  - Opt-In (users need to consent to earn exp)
  - Unlimited skills
  - Leaderboards
  - 100% Dynamic!
  - 0-99 levels (you can add/remove as many as you'd like) 
  - Automatic data backup (set to backup on sammi launch)
  - Stat system addon!

  ## Planned Features
  - Ability to easily rename stuff
  - Ability to use custom Exp Tables for each skill
  - Configurable stream based exp multiplier
  - - (to reward viewers for gifting subs/bits etc.)
  - Alias System
  - - (partly in place, just no way to change names yet)

  As long as SAMMI can trigger it, you can make a skill for it. All you need is the user_id from whatever triggered the button you want to add exp for.
setup: |
  1. Open SAMMI and the Bridge (bridge should be in OBS)
  2. On the left hand side of SAMMI, click the SAMMI Bridge button
  3. Navigate to "Install an Extension" and click that.
  4. Find where you downloaded "RPG System - Deck.sef" and install that. (It's important you install this one first and wait for it to finish initialising before installing the stats addon)
  5. Repeat steps 2-4 but install "RPG Stats - Deck.sef" instead.
