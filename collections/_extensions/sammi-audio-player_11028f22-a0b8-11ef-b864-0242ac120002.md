  SAMMI Audio Player is a custom built local server that allows you to send audio requests from SAMMI to play mp3/wavs. SAMMI Audio Player (or SAP) has been designed to make it easy to play audio through specific playback devices, play sounds from folders, wait for sounds to finish before continuing and of course, playing MP3/WAV files via SAMMI. At this current stage, SAP is only capable of playing Mp3/Wavs and no other audio format.
