overview: |
    <div class="alert alert-success mt-2" role="alert">Spotify is compatible for both OBSWS 4.1 and OBSWS 5.0 (and OBS 25). It requires SAMMI version 2022.4.4 and newer.
    </div>


    **This Spotify extension for SAMMI allows you to display and fully control your Spotify playback directly from your SAMMI.**


    It comes with a full Spotify player for SAMMI, OBS overlay (including viewer song requests overlay), and it's very easy to set up. 

    <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">The extension requires Spotify premium account. Without a premium account, you can still display your currently playing track in your OBS overlay, but cannot control playback from within SAMMI.
    </div>


    ##### Overlay for your stream
    Display your current track in your OBS overlay and SAMMI Deck, updated automatically as you listen to Spotify.

setup: |

    <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    Spotify is fully contained in SAMMI. Your Bridge does not have to be running for the extension to work.
    </div>

    <div markdown="1">
   
    0. Update SAMMI to the newest version.
    0. *(This only applies if you already use Spotify for SAMMI/LB2/LB1)*  
    Delete your Spotify scene in your OBS. The new Spotify scene is almost the same, however it now uses move filters and must be replaced. You must not already have the following sources in your OBS either: `Spotify Song, Spotify Artist, Spotify Image, Spotify Song Req Queue, Spotify Background, Spotify Queue BG`.
    1. Install or update [OBS Move Transition filter](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/move-transition.913/) to the latest version.
    2. Install the extension while connected to OBS. You can follow the [How to install an extension](https://sammi.solutions/docs/faq/general#installanextension) guide.
    3. A new Spotify scene should be added to your OBS. If you use multiple OBS, that's ok, we will install it in the next steps. 
    4. Go to your Spotify premade deck and press the green **Setup** button. Type F, press OK and **follow all the onscreen instructions**.   
    If the URL to retrieve your credentials doesn't open (as it's been migrated to a different platform and you might still be on an older version of the extension), please use this link to [Link your Spotify account](https://christinak.ca/extension-files/spotify-654879/auth.html).
    5. Press red **Install OBS** button to add the Spotify scene to your OBS.
    6. You're done!

    </div>

    <div markdown="1">
    <hr />
   
    ##### Protected Buttons
    This extensionâ€™s basic version has most of its buttons protected. You still get a fully functional extension and can freely modify or delete any buttons or commands, attach your own triggers etc. **You cannot open any nested commands** (these contain 'backend' commands that would be easy to break by non experienced users), **copy the commands or copy the buttons themselves**. 


    If you wish to be able to fully modify the extension (only recommended for very advanced users), you can purchase the **premium version** instead, which has all its buttons unlocked!
    **I do not provide documentation for any unlocked buttons and it's up to you to figure out their functionality.** 

    <hr />

    ##### Automatic Buttons
    You might notice these four black buttons. They're **fully automatic** (triggered from other buttons) and are not to be interacted with.

    in OBS Overlay** - set the maximum amount of song request tracks displayed in your OBS overlay (default = 10)
    - **Set Length Limit for Queue tracks displayed in OBS Overlay** - set the maximum character length for request track names in your OBS overlay (default = 35)
    - **Enable or disable reverse order of Queue tracks displayed in OBS Overlay** - decide whether you want to display your Queue tracks in your OBS in reverse order (i.e. the next one in the list will be on top
    and not bottom)
    - **Set Preferred Spotify Device (optional)**- set your preferred Spotify device to transfer your playback to when you launch SAMMI or use the Wake Up button. Skip this step if you always use the same device for your
    Spotify music while streaming.
    - **Set OBS Name (optional if using multiple OBS)** - set OBS name to install and control your OBS overlay. Skip this step if you're only using one single OBS.
    - **Set Spotify Errors** to show up as alerts or
    tray notifications - any spotify error is shown as a yellow alert at the bottom of SAMMI by default. You can set them to show as tray notification bubbles instead.
