overview: |
    **This Spotify extension for SAMMI allows you to display and fully control your Spotify playback directly from your SAMMI.**

    It comes with a full Spotify player for SAMMI, OBS overlay (including viewer song requests overlay), and it's very easy to set up. 

    <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">The extension requires Spotify premium account. Without a premium account, you can still display your currently playing track in your OBS overlay, but cannot control playback from within SAMMI.
    </div>
