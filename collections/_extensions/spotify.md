overview: |
    <div class="alert alert-success mt-2" role="alert">Spotify is compatible for both OBSWS 4.1 and OBSWS 5.0 (and OBS 25). It requires SAMMI version 2022.4.4 and newer.
    </div>


    **This Spotify extension for SAMMI allows you to display and fully control your Spotify playback directly from your SAMMI.**


    It comes with a full Spotify player for SAMMI, OBS overlay (including viewer song requests overlay), and it's very easy to set up. 

    <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">The extension requires Spotify premium account. Without a premium account, you can still display your currently playing track in your OBS overlay, but cannot control playback from within SAMMI.
    </div>


    ##### Overlay for your stream
