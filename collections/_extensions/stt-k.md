    #### Features
    ##### Language Selection
    Easily select the language you want to transcribe in, for better transcription accuracy.

    ##### Profanity Filter
    Some engines offer additional features like a profanity filter for cleaner transcriptions.

    ##### Auto Stop
    Configure the extension to automatically stop transcribing when silence is detected.

    ##### Usage Logging
    Keep track of your usage statistics with the built-in logging feature.

    #### Important Note
    - The extension is not intended to be used for live captioning, but rather for one time Speech to Text requests, similar to how 'Ok Google' or 'Hey Alexa' works.
    - The extension works best with Bridge running within OBS dock. I can't guarantee its performance outside OBS. 
    - You'll need a credit card to use any of these services.
