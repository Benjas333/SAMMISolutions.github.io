    #### Features
    ##### Language Selection
    Easily select the language you want to transcribe in, for better transcription accuracy.

    ##### Profanity Filter
    Some engines offer additional features like a profanity filter for cleaner transcriptions.

    ##### Auto Stop
    Configure the extension to automatically stop transcribing when silence is detected.

    ##### Usage Logging
    Keep track of your usage statistics with the built-in logging feature.

    #### Important Note
    - The extension is not intended to be used for live captioning, but rather for one time Speech to Text requests, similar to how 'Ok Google' or 'Hey Alexa' works.
    - The extension works best with Bridge running within OBS dock. I can't guarantee its performance outside OBS. 
    - You'll need a credit card to use any of these services.

setup: |
    0. Please make sure your SAMMI is updated to the latest version. OBS 29 or higher recommended.
    1. Install the extension. You can follow the [Extension Install Guide](https://sammi.solutions/docs/faq/general#installanextension).
    2. Add the `--use-fake-ui-for-media-stream` flag to your OBS executable (if Bridge is running as a dock in OBS):
        1. Navigate to where your OBS shortcut or obs64.exe is located. This could be on your desktop, taskbar, or in the Start menu. Alternatively, find the obs64.exe file in your Program Files folder.
        2. If you're using the obs64.exe, right-click on it and choose Create shortcut..
        3. Modify Properties: Right-click on the new shortcut and choose Properties.
        4. Add Flag: In the Target field, you'll see the path to obs64.exe. Add a space at the end of this line and then add `--use-fake-ui-for-media-stream`. The Target field should look something like this: `"C:\Program Files\obs-studio\bin\64bit\obs64.exe" --use-fake-ui-for-media-stream``
        5. Click OK or Apply to save these changes. 
        6. Now, whenever you launch OBS from this shortcut, it will run with this particular flag, which is required for this extension. 
        ![Flag added to OBS shortcut correctly](sttk_flag.png)
    3. Navigate to the premade deck and open the Settings button to set up the extension: 
       - **General Settings**
         - Default Engine - Default engine to use in all your queries
         - Silence Length - If Auto Stop is enabled, the transcription will automatically stop after X seconds of silence
         - Silence Threshold - Define what level of noise is considered 'silence', adjust for noisier settings
         - Log Usage - Track your usage with Get and Reset Usage commands. Accuracy is not guaranteed, setting up billing alerts is **STRONGLY ADVISED** for all used services to avoid unexpected charges.
    4. Check your recording device is correctly set (only available if Bridge is running inside OBS dock)
       - Navigate to Bridge - STT by K tab and optionally choose a different recording device
    5. Continue setting up your desired engine inside Settings button. See more information for each engine and its settings below. 

    <div class="alert alert-warning mt-2" role="alert">If you're running Bridge outside of OBS (NOT recommended), you must go to the Bridge - STT by K tab and click 'Allow Recording' to grant Bridge microphone access every time you refresh Bridge or relaunch SAMMI.</div>
