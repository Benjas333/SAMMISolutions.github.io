overview: |

    **This 3-in-1 extension for SAMMI is all you need for your Text-To-Speech needs!** 

    **It supports regular Web Speech API, Google API and Amazon Polly API for text synthesis. That's around 400 different voices and over 50 languages!**

    ##### Web Speech API
    Web Speech API is a **completely free and unlimited** API for TTS. It contains all voices supported by your browser and works when running Bridge from within OBS in a dock (only for OBS 27.2 and higher). 

    ##### Google Cloud Text-to-Speech
    Google provides its own TTS service with around 300 voices and 50 languages.  

    Google Cloud's free tier lets you use up to **4 million standard or 1 million neural characters per month for **completely free. The free usage limit does not expire, but may be subject to change.  

    See the up-to-date pricing details at the [official Google site](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/pricing).   
    *Google TTS requires a valid credit card to confirm your identity*. 


    ##### Amazon Polly
    Amazon provides a TTS service with around 66 different voices.  

    You get a **free tier for the first 12 months starting from your first request for speech.**  
    The free tier includes **5 million standard and 1 million free neural characters per month**.

    See the up-to-date pricing details at the [official AWS site](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/pricing/).  
    *Amazon TTS requires a valid credit card to confirm your identity*. 

    ##### Playback Controls
    You can play, pause, skip and control the volume of your TTS (some commands are not fully supported for the regular Web Speech API).

    ##### Voice Settings
    You can change the pitch and speed for all TTS services.   
    Amazon Polly offers soft and whispered voices.

    ##### Random Voice
    For each service, you can choose the TTS voice to be completely random! That will make for some funny moments for your viewers for sure! 

    ##### Automatic Queue
    You can easily queue up all your TTS requests and they will be queued up and play one by one. This is fully automatic!  

    *Queue for Polly and Amazon TTS is combined, while Web Speech API has its own separate queue.*
