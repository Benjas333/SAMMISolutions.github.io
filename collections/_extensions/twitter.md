setup: |

    {% include alert.html text="Updating from a previous 1.X Twitter version? Please completely uninstall the current Twitter extension by navigating to SAMMI Core-Bridge-Uninstall extension, and delete the premade Twitter deck before proceeding. The commands names have changed, none of your existing commands will work anymore." type="warning" %} 

    1. Install the extension. You can follow the [Extension Install Guide](https://sammi.solutions/extensions/install).
    2. Log into Twitter
        - Go to your Bridge - Twitter Tab.
        - Click on Login select Open or Copy Twitter URL (and open it).
        - Copy your provided PIN
        - Fill out the "Enter PIN" input field and click on Authenticate. Once it says `Logged in`, you're all good to go.
    3. It's **strongly recommended** to get your own credentials, as the default ones have a quota limit applicable to all users using the extension.
